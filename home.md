# Conjectural Technologies Wiki
Conjectural Technologies is my one-man LLC for all things Google Workspace. Licensing, consulting, the whole bit. The Wiki is where I document all the edge cases, odd interactions, tips, tricks, and so on that I come across. Everything is Markdown, and pull requests are welcome.

Most of the content is in the Google folder â€” click it to expand the pages on the left.
